Finance Dashboard (Power BI)

📊 Goal: Create an interactive finance dashboard that doesn't just show numbers — it helps people explore them, drill down, and truly *see* what matters.

⚙️ Tools & Tech: Power BI, DAX, Excel data source, Waterfall model

✅ What I built:
- A sleek dashboard with navigation, KPI cards, slicers, and drill-through — so numbers feel alive, not static
- Custom DAX measures to spotlight insights decision‑makers actually care about
- Structured the build using the waterfall model for clarity and trust

🧠 Why this matters:
Data isn't useful until it answers real questions. This dashboard lets anyone go beyond the surface, ask “what if?”, and find actionable answers.
